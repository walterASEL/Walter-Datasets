# Walter-Datasets

Datasets have been updated in the R Markdown files (.Rmd). Any code in R scripts (.R) should no longer be used as they may include code that has been depracated or packages no longer are maintained. This will likely be the last update prior to the considerable changes to the raster and rgdal packages coming at the end of 2023.
